## Education
I've recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://ub.ac.ir/">University of Bojnurd</a> and I am currently studying master of software engineering at <a href="https://imamreza.ac.ir/">Imam Reza International University</a> located in Mashhad. Currently, my GitHub profile includes some of my academic projects and exercises. As I am mainly interested in web development, some of these exercises and projects are related to website design using HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery, some of them have a deeper focus on JavaScript topics, and a few of them include PHP and AJAX.
