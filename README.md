## Education
I'm recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from <a href="https://ub.ac.ir/">bojnord Univercity</a>. I am currently studying software engineering at the master's level at <a href="https://imamreza.ac.ir/">Imam Reza University</a> located in Mashhad. I am interested in web development. I put a series of small projects and exercises I did during my undergraduate course on GitHub. Some of these exercises and projects are related to website design using HTML, CSS, SASS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT and JQUERY, and some focus more on JAVASCRIPT topics, and a few of these projects use PHP and AJAX.
